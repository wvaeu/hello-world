# hello-world
My first repository!!

Hello hello! This is my first time using GitHub and I'm really excited. For context, I'm in the middle of my first-ever CS class (intro to programming at USC) and will be starting as an intern at Ripple where I'll be helping the Xpring team build the open platform for money :)

My current goals:
- Practice practice practice
- Learn more so I can write simple code
- Contribute to an open source project
