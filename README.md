# hello-world
My first repository!!

Hello hello! This is my first time using GitHub and I'm really excited. For context, I'm in the middle of my first-ever CS class (intro to programming at USC) and will be starting an internship at @Ripple this summer. 

My current goals:
- Practice practice practice
- Learn how to write beautiful code
- Contribute to an open source project
